## Issues

Due to a conflict with the new version of react-router-dom, I was not able to write tests for the project. Specifically, the useNavigate hook in react-router-dom always throws an error during testing, even though it works fine in the project itself.And this hook is widely used in the project. I am currently investigating this issue, and any assistance in resolving it would be greatly appreciated.
